Hiredly: An AI-Powered Job Portal
Project Overview
Hiredly is a cutting-edge job portal designed to revolutionize the recruitment process for both job seekers and companies. Going beyond traditional job boards, this platform integrates a sophisticated microservices architecture to provide a comprehensive and modern hiring experience.

The core of Hiredly is its unique AI-based interview simulator and a robust technical test engine. These features allow job seekers to prepare for and demonstrate their skills in a realistic, automated environment, while providing recruiters with deep, data-driven insights into a candidate's abilities.
